        wasn't a part of the story to begin with. He was meant to be a reader,
        never part of the story. Yet, it became a world where he could find
        companionship and family, something he never had. A world where he
        finally felt like his existence had a purpose. He finally had a reason
        to live for, people to fight for and lives to protect. However, he can
        never get his ending because he was never a part of the story to begin
        with. It was nothing more than a fleeting dream, a mere illusion of
        happiness that he could never attain. Perhaps it had already been over
        before it even began. Indulging in something that never belonged.
