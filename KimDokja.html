    <p><a href="https://omniscient-readers-viewpoint.fandom.com/wiki/Kim_Dokja">Kim Dokja</a> wasn't a part of the story to begin <br> with. He was meant to be a reader, never part <br> of the story. Yet, it became a world where he <br> could find companionship and family, <br> something he never had. A world where he <br>finally felt like his existence had a purpose. <br> He finally had a reason to live for, people to <br> fight for and lives to protect. However, he can <br> never get his ending because he was never a <br> part of the story to begin with. It was nothing <br> more than a fleeting dream, a mere illusion of <br> happiness that he could never attain. Perhaps <br> it had already been over before it even began. <br> Indulging in something that never belonged.</p>
